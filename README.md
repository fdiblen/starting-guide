## Registration at the City Hall (getting BSN number)
You can ask for appointment at:
http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/expatcenter/expats/online-appointment-form-for-individuals

Typically they will give you an appointment for the next week.


## Bank Account

In order to open a Dutch bank account, you need to have a BSN number.

However, ABN AMRO offers expats to have a bank account without BSN number. You need to provide them your
BSN number within 8 weeks.
You can ask for appointment here:
https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/payments/open-an-account/f_afspraak.html

They will contact you by e-mail and ask for the branch and time you prefer. 
It might be useful to provide this information when you ask for appointment.

Address:
ABN AMRO Bank
World Trade Center Amsterdam
Strawinskylaan 31
+31 900 0024


You can also call and ask for appointment. Actually, this is easier and faster. 
They can give you an appointment for the next day.
